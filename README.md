Neighbourhood Map
=================

##Description
A single-page application featuring a map of my local area. Functionality has been added to the application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places you may like to visit, a search function with auto-complete to easily discover these locations, and a list-view to support simple browsing of all locations.

Third-party APIs, including Foursquare and Flickr have been used to provide additional information about each of these locations.

##Usage
To run the site, download the files and open `index.min.html` in your browser.

###Gulp usage
Gulp has been used in this project for optimisation tasks. Critical-path CSS has been added inline at the top of `index.html`, images have been compressed, and scripts concatenated and minified.

All main tasks are included in the default gulp task, so simply run gulp in the command line, where `gulpfile.js` is located, to replicate the optimisations for this project.

All working files are located in the `src` directory. Gulp tasks will output to the `dist` directory.
